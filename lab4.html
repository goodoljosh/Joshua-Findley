            <ul><p>Cheese sandwiches can be grilled or fried so that the brad toasts and the cheese melts(a dish referred to as a grilled cheese sandwich, or simply grilled cheese). A grilled cheese is often heated by placing the buttered slices of bread, with the cheese between the slices, on a frying pan or griddle.  </p>  
            <p>Now that you know what a grilled cheese is, we will now go through how to make a bacon and tomato grilled cheese. First, put an healthy amount of butter on your bread after heating your skillet or pan with butter in it as well. Then, put your cheese on  the bread and wait for the cheese to start to melt. When the cheese is melted put on your bacon and tomato and close the sandwich. Toast the bread until golden brown and serve with a horizontal cut and tomato soup.</p> </ul>
